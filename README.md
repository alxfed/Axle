# Axle

Axle is a platform for automation of adaptive experiments.

Adaptive experimentation is the machine-learning guided process of iteratively
exploring a variable or parameter space of the experiment. 
Bayesian optimization in Ax is powered by [BoTorch](https://github.com/facebookexternal/botorch),
a modern library for Bayesian optimization research built on PyTorch.
